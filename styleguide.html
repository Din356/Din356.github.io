    <div class="text font-black mt mb bg-white mcenter width50">That's right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not
        human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on
        telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.
        Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in
        the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling
        how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how
        the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the
        villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the
        other steps in the Ascent of Man.</div>
        
        <div class="text font-black mt mb mcenter">If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because
        it's useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of
        rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have
        you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger
        kind of pouch or bag, a container for people , and then later on you
        take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider
        container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the
        museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and
        then next day you probably do much the same again-if to do that is
        human, if that's what it takes, then I am a human being after all.
        Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.</div>
        
        <div class="text font-black mt mb">Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human
        being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with
        my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don't, nor does
        anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It's just one of
        those d amned things you have to do in order to be able to go on
        gathering wild oats and telling stories.</div>
        
        <div class="text font-black mt mb">It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my
        humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about
        bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful,
        poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.</div>
       
        <div class="text font-black mt mb">It sometimes seems that that story is approaching its end. Lest
        there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the
        wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we'd better start telling another
        one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one's finished. Maybe.</div>
        
        The trouble is, we've all let ourselves become part of
        the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is
        with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject,
        words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.
        It's it doesn't come easily, thoughtlessly to the lips as
        the killer story does; but still, "untold" was an exaggeration. People
        have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and
        ways. 
        
        Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels ...
        The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. Of course
        the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature
        and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while
        making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse
        to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the
        Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the
        arrmv or spear, starting heTe and going straight there and THOK!
        hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the
        story isn't any good if he isn't in it.
        
        I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural,
        proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A
        book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel
        is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.
        One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of
        conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have
        read a how-to-write manual that said, "A story should be seen as a
        battle," and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict,
        competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as
        carrier bag I belly I box I house I medicine bundle, may be seen as
        necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized
        either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.
        
        Finally, it's clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He
        needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and
        he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.
        That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in
        them.
        
        So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging
        this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and
        klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and
        intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to
        contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time 
        on another world, and a mouse's skull; full of
        beginnings without ends, of initiations, oflosses, of transformations
        and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than 
        snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck,
        missions that fail, and people who don't understand. I said it was
        hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from
        their husks, I didn't say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a
        novel was easy?
        
        If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its
        myth is tragic. "Technology," or "modern science" (using the words
        as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for
        the "hard" sciences and high technology founded upon continuous
        economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, 
        conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The
        fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant
        (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and
        tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).
        
        If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, T ime's-(killing)-
        arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and
        science as primarily cu ltural carrier bag rather than weapon of
        domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be
        seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or
        apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a
        realistic one .
        
        It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.
        
        Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however
        funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what
        people actually do and feel , how people relate to everything else in
        this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be
        and tomb of things that were, this unending story. In it, as in all
        fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in
        his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather
        plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and
        listen to Ool's joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn't over. 
        Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.  </div>
